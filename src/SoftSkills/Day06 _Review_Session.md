#What is Software Testing?

It is a method to check whether the actual software product
matches expected requirements and to ensure that software
product is Defect/Bug free.


## Why do we need software testing?

To gain customer confidence

To check software adaptability

To identify errors

To avoid extra costs

To avoid risks

To optimise business


## Software defect/bug can be fatal!

E.g. Boeing 747 Max airplane crash

Software defects may cause

Loss of billions.

E.g. Google authentication

crashed in 2020

## What is a software application?

Application is software that performs specific tasks for an end-user.
Application software programs are created to facilitate a variety of functions,
including but not limited to:

- managing information

- manipulating data

- coordinating resources

- calculating figures

- Facebook, slack, zoom and etc...

## How to build a software?

1) Planning
2) Analysis
3) Design
4) Build
5) Testing
6) Deploy
7) Maintain

#SDLC

- **Software development life cycle** is a process for planning, creating,
testing, and deploying an information system.

The goal of a SDLC is to allow successful production of a high-quality
solution that would meet or exceed the requirements of a customer
at all its phases, within the provided budget and timelines.


## PLANNING

Identification of the system for development

Creation of project plan

Find scope solution

Estimate cost and efforts

Identify risk and benefits

## Requirements Gathering

Architects, developers, and product managers document the business
processes that need software automation.

Focus on functional requirements

Perform solution analysis

Identify End Users needs

**Requirement**: is a service, function or feature that a user needs. Requirements can be
functions, constraints, business rules or other elements that must be present to meet
the need of the intended users.

**Functionality of an application**: Functionality is the sum or any aspect of what a
product, such as a software application or computing device, can do for a user.


### Source of Requirements:

Customers

Business Partners

Domain Experts

Industry Analysts

End-Users


### Requirement Gathering:

Product owner (PO) documents(writes) the requirements:

Business Requirements (BR)

System Requirement Specification (SRS)

Market Requirements (MR)

Functional Requirements (FR)

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)


## System Requirement Specification (SRS)

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document that describes what the
software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the
functionality the product needs to fulfill all stakeholders (business, users) needs.

## Requirement Gathering

### Requirements should be SMART:

Specific

Measurable

Attainable

Realistic

Testable


# S.M.A.R.T.

**Specific Requirement**

- All users should be able to see all the foods

**Measurable Requirement**

- The application should function quickly

**Attainable Requirement**

- The users can decide the foods order by their name

**Realistic Requirement**

- The users get discounts whenever the user want

**Testable Requirement**

- I want application remarkable

## DESIGN

Developers and software architects start designing the software after
they have identified requirements.

Elaborate core specification, features, functions, and flows to meet
the requirements.


## DEVELOPMENT

Developers will obey certain predefined coding guidelines during this
process.

Actual development begins here following the design. Code reviews,
unit testing are done.


## TESTING

QA team tests the software for errors/bugs and determines if the
solution meets the business goals.

Testers refer to the document to make sure the software conforms to
the customerâ€™s standard.


## Software Deployment

In this phase, the goal is to deploy the software to the manufacturing
environment so that consumers can start using the product.

After successful testing, software gets deployed in production
environment for user acceptance and approval.


## Benefits of SDLC:

Using the SDLC it is easy to measure the growth and costs of the
developed system

SDLC enhances the control and monitoring of the big or complex
projects.

SDLC involves well detailed and comprehensive steps.

The design reviews help to ensure the reliability and quality of the
developed solution.

SDLC provides extensive documentation of the system.


## The List of SDLC models

The list of SDLC models which have gained popularity and accepted industry-wide throughout the years:

- Spiral Model
- V Model
- Waterfall Methodology
- **Agile Model**

The list of SDLC models which have gained popularity and accepted industry-wide throughout the years:

- Spiral Model - is an example of an iterative development.  Risk handling.
- V Model - Verification and validation model.
- Waterfall Methodology - it's very simple but idealistic. 
- **Agile Model** - is a time bound, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally from the start of a project, instead of trying to deliver all at once.

## AGILE/WATERFALL

### Agile 
- smooth segregation of a project into useful parts
for better results.
- Cumulative outcomes.

### Waterfall 
- Comprehensive and holistic view towards the implementation of a project.   
- Big outcome at the end.


# Waterfall Methodology

Requirements --> Design --> Implementation --> Testing --> Deployment 

# Agile methodology

Able to move quickly and easily.  Agile is a software development methodology.


# Agile is a Software Development Methodology

- People work together as one team

- More human communication, and face-to-face interaction

- Continuous feedback from users

- Visibility of progress and transparency of process

- Shorter development cycles, and more frequent deployment


# Agile Methodology 12 Principles/Rules

1) Satisfy the customer
2) Welcome change
3) Deliver frequently
4) Work together
5) Trust and support
6) Face to face converstaion
7) Working software
8) Sustainable development
9) Continous attention
10) Maintain simplicity
11) Self organizing teams
12) Reflect and adjust

## Welcome change
In the world around us, change is the only constant.  Agile principles and values support responding to these changes rather than moving us forward in spite of them. 

## Face to Face conversations
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation.

## Working software
Working software is the primary measure of progress.  Ship software often: a useful product now is better than a perfect one later.

## Maintain Simplicity
Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.


## Agile Manifesto: Agile vs Non-Agile

### Agile                             
- Individuals and
Interactions

- Working Software

- Customer Collaboration

- Responding to Change


### Non-Agile
- Process and tools
- Comprehensive
- Contract Negotiations
- Following a Plan


### Agile Software Development Methodologies

- Scrum
- Crystal
- Kanban
- XP
- FDD
- RUP
- DSDM
- and a few more ....


### Agile has several frameworks

- XP (Extreme Program)
- **Kanban**
- **Scrum**
- Crystal
- RUP (Rational Unified Process)

## Agile - Scrum

- Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time.

- Scrum uses iterative process.

- The business sets the priorities.  Team self organize to determine the best way to deliver the highest priority features.


Advantage of Using Scrum Framework
- Scrum framework is fast moving and money efficient
- Scrum is adaptive in nature because it has short spring.  
- In Scrum customer, satisfaction is very important.
