### How to configure Cucumber in Eclipse
In this section, we will see how to add relevant JARs to a Java project so that you can setup Cucumber in Eclipse. In case you have already worked with the TestNG framework, follow the same procedure for adding required Jars to the project. In case you are just getting started with Selenium automation testing, you may follow the below steps for realizing Cucumber setup in Eclipse:

### Step 1

Open the Eclipse exe by double-clicking on the same. If you are opening it for the first time you will get an option to select the workspace where all the created projects will be saved.

You can change your workspace directory anytime by using the Browse button.

### Step 2

Click on the Launch button and you will see the Welcome window of Eclipse.

### Step 3

The next step is to create a Project. Navigate to File > New > Java Project for creating a new project.

### Step 4

Next, you will see a window to enter your project name. Give a name to your project and click on the Finish button.

You will now be able to see your project in the Project Explorer window.

### Step 5

Now that the project is ready, it’s time to add the relevant Cucumber and Selenium JARs to your project. I have already downloaded the Selenium and Cucumber JARs since these JAR files are required for to setup Cucumber in Eclipse.

Right-click on the Sample Project in the project explorer and navigate to Build Path > Configure Build Path.

### Step 6

Now click on Add External JARs button

### Step 7

Browse to the location where you have downloaded the JAR files and select the downloaded Cucumber JARs and click Open.

### Step 8

Similarly, add all the Selenium JARs required for completing the Cucumber setup in Eclipse. Upon adding, you will see the JARs under the Libraries tab.

### Step 9

Finally, click on Apply and Close. With this, you have successfully imported the JARs required to setup Cucumber in Eclipse. The imported JARs will be visible under the ‘Referenced Libraries’ tab of the project.
