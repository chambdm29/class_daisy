# How to install Cucumber in IntelliJ
Now that we have setup Cucumber in Eclipse, let’s look at how to configure Cucumber with IntelliJ (another popular IDE for Java development) in this section of IntelliJ Cucumber tutorial. Here are the steps to configure Cucumber in IntelliJ.

### Step 1

Launch the IntelliJ IDE and navigate to File > New > Project.

### Step 2

Select Java and click on Next.

### Step 3

Give a name to your project and click on Finish.

### Step 4

You will get a prompt to open the project in the same window or a new window.You can select ‘This Window’.

### Step 5

You will see the project getting displayed in the project explorer.

### Step 6

Import the required JARs for Selenium and Cucumber, similar to how it was done with Cucumber setup in Eclipse. To do so, navigate to File > Project Structure > Modules.

### Step 7

As highlighted in the above screenshot select the Dependencies Tab. Add the required dependencies by clicking on the ‘+’ sign towards the bottom and select the required JARs (or Directories).

### Step 8

Select the JARs through the ‘browse menu’ and click on OK.

### Step 9

On similar lines, add the Selenium JARs. With this, the Cucumber Selenium dependencies are added to the project. Click on Apply and then press OK.

Like Cucumber setup in Eclipse, the imported JARs will be available under the ‘External Libraries’ section.
